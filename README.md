# Tableau_Project
Tableau project showing the occurrence of Earthquake allover the world
Scenario: Imagine you are a data analyst at an Insurance company trying to gain insights on
major earthquakes and determine their hotspots in each continent. This analysis using historical
data on earthquakes would enable you to develop insurance products suitable for the customers
living in these active regions.
1. Create a geographical visualization to plot all earthquakes that occurred on Earth
between 1900 and 2013. Identify the magnitude of each earthquake?

2. Using a scatter-plot color try to address following questions.
1. Is there a correlation between Depth and Magnitude variables for occurrences
of (>7 magnitude on Richter scale) mega earthquakes?
2. Summarize your fndings
3. Which country or continent had higher occurrences of (> 7 magnitudes on Richter scale)
earthquakes? Hint: Using a Lasso tool in Tableau to manually select marks (data points)
in your visualization. After selecting the data points, export them to an excel fle)

4. Finally prepare a dashboard and storyline summarizing your analysis on earthquakes
and their occurrences in various places of the earth. This aim of this report is to
communicate these insights to other stakeholders in a visually appealing format.
The fnal output could look like the representation on the next page
